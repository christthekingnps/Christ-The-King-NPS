    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>Christ the King NPS is a privately managed school that was founded in 2017 and became fully operational in February 2018. <br>
       The idea about the school was first conceived when Mrs. Sylvia Omodo (founder member) was working at Iceme Primary School where she  <br>
       started a nursery section and that proved to be successful that before her retirement from government service, she started the plan <br>
       to establish a privately owned primary school. That was when she joined forces with her husband, Mr. Omodo Denis to mobilize resource <br>
       to start the operation of the school. Its operation was restricted during the covid-19 pandemic that began ravaging the world in 2020 <br>
       Sylvia passed away on 5 August 2021 after a long illness with cancer and it was only natural that her family decided to preserve her legacy <br>
       by continuing to manage the school to realize her vision of promoting access to an excellent education among rural children. <br>
       Forever, she will be remembered as an educationist who transformed education in Oyam District and beyond in her capacity as a classroom teacher, <br>
       headteacher, and the acting District Education Officer over several decades of service to the nation. <br>
       Our core values include honesty, respect, diginity, accountability and transparency. <br>
       We are improving the quality of education within the region through an integrated approach that does not only entails having a conducive learning <br>
       environment for the pupils but also recruitment, retention and capacity building for our staff.</p>
