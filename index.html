<h2 style="color:green"; id="myHeader";> About Us </h2> 
  
</style>
  
<p> Christ the King Nursery and Primary School was established in 2018 with the view of increasing access to quality education for children from <br>
    poor economic background. The school is located 47 km from Lira city and 350 km from Kampala, the capital city of Uganda. Presently, the <br>
    school has 64 and150 pupils in its nursery and primary sections respectively. Additionally, the school has 10 teachers who oversee the day to day <br>
    running of the school. The pioneers of the school are currently in primary four.
</p>
<p> The school is privately owned by Mr. Omodo Denis and Mrs. Sylvia Omodo. They have a vision of making the school a fully operational boarding school<br>
    by 2021 to ensure improved performance of the students. They started the school with the aim of reducing litracy level among poor households. Majority <br>
    of these households are located in remote areas and send children to rural schools where there is little attention from district education office.<br>
  </p>



 <h3> School Management</h3>

<p> Christ the King Nursery and Primary School has an aministrative structure (School Management Committee) which oversee the overall direction for growth <br>
    and development of the school. The headteacher is charged with the responsibility of day-to-day management of school affairs. He/she ensures that teachers <br>
    perform their tasks in a very conductive environment.<br>
